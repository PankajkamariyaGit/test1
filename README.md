# Assessment3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

**Example Inputs:**
```
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
```
**Solution**

We are using js editor to validate the output.

Since the values are hard-coded, we can use developer tool from Chrome to run the js file submitted in the assessment
